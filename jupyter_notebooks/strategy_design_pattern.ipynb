    "### Introduction to the Strategy Design Pattern \n",
    "Design Patterns, in general, are a set of best practices that can be used to solve common problems. The Strategy design pattern is one of the most common design patterns in software development, as it is used to solve the problem of selecting the correct algorithm to use for a given problem. The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. In this context, it is used to select the appropriate model for the problem of predicting the power flow results of a power system."
